A way to deal with the development of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is portrayed. If the classification categories are not roughly evenly represented in a dataset, 
that dataset is imbalanced. Real-world data sets typically consist mostly of "normal" examples, with only a small number of "abnormal" or "interesting" ones. 
The imbalance dataset leads to the problem of biased model which misclassifies the minority samples as the majority instances. Many works have been introduced on
oversampling the minority instances in the tabular data. In our work, we have extracted the features with the help of convolution neural network. Then we have generated 
synthetic samples and checked our results over various performance metrics.
